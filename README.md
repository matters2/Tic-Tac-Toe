:video_game:Intro:
Project requirement is to build an interactive front-end Tic Tac Toe game, that has been built with HTML, styled with CSS and programmed with JavaScript.

:key:Features:
  - Live score board counter
  - Reset function
  - Click sounds
  - Responsive design
  - CSS animation and transform effects
  - To be added (day and night mode)
 
:rocket:Challenges:
As an introduction to DOM manipulation, I found it difficult initially to get the JavaScript code to line up correctly with the game user-interface. For example, ensuring the live score board counter worked only in the event of a win, and not a draw, for the correct player, and that the scores would be reset only in the event the game was restarted. Overall, this project was a great learning experience and introduction of program development.
