Intro:
Project requirement is to build an interactive front-end Tic Tac Toe game, that has been built with HTML, styled with CSS and programmed with JavaScript.

Features:
  - Live score board counter
  - Reset function
  - Click sounds
  - Responsive design
  - CSS animation and transform effects
  - To be added (day and night mode)
 
Challenges:
As an introduction to DOM manipulation, I found it difficult initially to get the JavaScript code to line up correctly with the game interface. For example ensuring the live score board counter worked only in the event of a win, and not draw, and that the scores would be reset when the game was restarted. Overall, was a great learning experience and a chance to play around the with CSS funtionality.
